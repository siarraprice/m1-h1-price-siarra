The only trouble I had with this was making a new branch and then merging them back together. I couldn't figure out how to do it at first - but then I realized I had to commit the changes in the test branch first. After that, I was able to merge. I never received an error message like you mentioned in the homework requirements, so I'm not sure where I went wront (or didn't go wrong...?) at that point.
